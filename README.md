# Neuron Tracking in C. elegans
This project develops a method for tracking fluorescent neuronal nuclei in C. elegans using a graph attention-based neural network and nonrigid registration algorithms. It aims to improve the efficiency of tracking neurons in freely behaving worms, enhancing the understanding of neural activity and behavior.

## Description

## Key Features
- Utilizes graph neural networks for detecting and linking fluorescent objects.
- Integrates features from segmentation for improved neuron identification.
- Employs nonrigid registration to handle deformations and partial matches.
  
## Getting Started
Pelase use the NAS datasets at the folder '/2024/Hang/ZM9624'
